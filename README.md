Hi! My name is Anitej, and I'm studying Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Mathematics at [Rutgers University](https://rutgers.edu). I'm currently a Software Development Engineer Intern at [Amazon](https://amazon.com), working on Alexa hands-free for mobile devices. I'm excited to be joining [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com) (a hyperlocal social networking platform) as a Software Engineering Intern during summer 2021.

Last fall, I worked part time as a Learning Assistant for the [Rutgers Learning Centers](https://rlc.rutgers.edu), conducting recitations for an introductory programming course taught in MATLAB. Last summer, I worked on backend development at [MealMe](https://mealme.ai), a venture-backed food software startup. Before that, I've conducted research at [Rutgers Center of Alcohol Studies](https://alcoholstudies.rutgers.edu) involving biological applications of machine learning, and spent two summers developing data center infrastructure tools at [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com).

I'm proficient in Python, Git, and an assortment of other languages, tools and technologies. I'm a quick learner, strong communicator, hard worker, and meaningful addition to any team I join. In my free time, I [sing](https://rutgersraag.com)!
