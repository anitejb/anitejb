Hi! My name is Anitej (he/him/his), and I'm studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at [Rutgers University](https://rutgers.edu). I'm currently a Software Engineer Intern at [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com), a hyperlocal social networking platform.

Previously, I've put my software engineering skills to use at [Amazon](https://amazon.com) (working on Alexa hands-free for mobile devices), [MealMe](https://mealme.ai) (a venture backed food software startup - working on backend infrastructure), and [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com) (working on data center infrastructure operations). In addition, I've dabbled in teaching (as a Learning Assistant for an introductory programming class taught in MATLAB) and research (working on biological applications of machine learning).

I'm proficient in Python, Git, and an assortment of other languages, tools and technologies. I'm a quick learner, strong communicator, hard worker, and meaningful addition to any team I join. In my free time, I [sing](https://rutgersraag.com)!

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/anitejb) or email me at anitej.biradar@gmail.com :)
