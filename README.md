Hi! My name is Anitej (he/him), and I'm a graduate student studying Statistics and Data Science at [Rutgers University](https://rutgers.edu), with an Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am currently seeking new grad positions for 2023 in Software Engineering, Machine Learning Engineering, Data Science, or other related roles. If you think I'd be a good fit for your company, reach out to me at anitej.biradar@gmail.com!*

Previously, I've put my software engineering skills to use at
- [Amazon Music](https://amazon.com/music) (working on apps for Android Auto/Android Automotive OS)
- [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com) (a hyperlocal social networking platform - working on observability and product infrastructure),
- [Amazon Alexa](https://amazon.com/alexa) (working on Alexa hands-free for mobile devices),
- [MealMe](https://mealme.ai) (a venture backed food software startup - working on backend infrastructure), and
- [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com) (working on data center infrastructure operations).

In addition, I've spent time teaching (as a Learning Assistant for an introductory programming class taught in MATLAB) and contributing to research (working on biological applications of machine learning, and game development for analyzing artificial social intelligence).

I'm proficient in Python, Git, and an assortment of other languages, tools and technologies. I'm a quick learner, strong communicator, hard worker, and meaningful addition to any team I join. In my free time, I [sing](https://www.youtube.com/user/RutgersRAAG)!
